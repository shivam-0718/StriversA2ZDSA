/*
    You are the owner of a Shipment company. You use conveyor belts to ship packages from one port to another.
    The packages must be shipped within 'd' days.

    The weights of the packages are given in an array 'of weights'.
    The packages are loaded on the conveyor belts every day in the same order as they appear in the array.
    The loaded weights must not exceed the maximum weight capacity of the ship (sum of weights in 1 day <= capacity).
    Find out the least-weight capacity so that you can ship all the packages within 'd' days.

    Ex: weights[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], d = 5

        By considering capacity of ship = 15
        1st day = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 2nd day = [6, 7], 3rd day = [8], 4th day = [9], 5th day = [10]
        Total days to ship all weights = 5, which is <= d. Hence least capacity of ship = 15
