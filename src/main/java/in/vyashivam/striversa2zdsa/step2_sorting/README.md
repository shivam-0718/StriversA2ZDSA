## ðŸ”¢ Sorting Techniques in Arrays (Step 2)

Sorting is the process of arranging elements in a specific order 
(ascending or descending) to improve data organization, searching, 
and processing efficiency.

- **Selection Sort**
    - Repeatedly, selecting the minimum (or maximum) element from unsorted array and swapping it with the first element in the correct position.
    - Time Complexity: O(nÂ²).
    - Space Complexity: O(1).


- **Bubble Sort**
    - Repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
    - This moves the maximum element to the end.
    - Time Complexity: O(nÂ²) (Worst & Average case); O(n) (Best case, if array is nearly sorted).
    - Space Complexity: O(1).


- **Insertion Sort**
    - Builds the sorted array one element at a time by taking an element and inserting it into their correct position.
    - Time Complexity: O(nÂ²) (Worst & Average case); O(n) (Best case, when array is nearly sorted).  
    - Space Complexity: O(1).


- **Merge Sort**
    - Divide and Merge: Splits the array into halves, sorts them, and merges back into the same array.
    - Time Complexity: O(n log n).
    - Space Complexity: O(n).


- **Quick Sort**
    - Divide and Conquer: Selecting a pivot, placing it in correct order; smaller on left and larger on right.
    - Placing pivot will partition elements around it, then recursively sorting subarrays.
    - Time Complexity: O(nÂ²) (Worst case), O(n log n) (Best & Average case). 
    - Space Complexity: O(log n).
