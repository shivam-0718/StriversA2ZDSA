# Strivers A2Z DSA 

This repository contains Java solutions to problems from **Striver's A2Z DSA Course**. 
The course covers fundamental data structures and algorithms through practice problems, sourced from coding platforms such as LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, Coding Ninjas, and others.

## Features

- All solutions implemented in **Java** for clarity and interview preparation
- Comprehensive coverage of core **data structures and algorithms**: arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, sorting, searching, and more
- Problems structured and solved in the sequence laid out by Striverâ€™s A2Z DSA Sheet, ideal for revision and concept reinforcement.

Strivers A2Z DSA course is available [here](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2/)

## Repository Structure
- Solutions are implemented in Java programming language.
- You can use programming language of your own choice.
